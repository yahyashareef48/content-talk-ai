## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Create an env.ts file in the root directory and add your Gemini API key by exporting it as shown below:

```ts
export const GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY";
```

To get your **GEMINI_API_KEY**, go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/), click on **Get API Key**, and generate a new key.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
